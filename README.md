# Bunruija
Bunruija is a text classification toolkit.
Bunruija aims at enabling pre-processing, training and evaluation of text classification models with **minimum coding effort**.
Bunruija is mainly focusing on Japanese though it is also applicable to other languages..

See `example` for understanding how bunruija is easy to use.

## Highlights
- **Minimum requirements of coding**: Bunruija enables users to train and evaluate their models through command lines. Because all experimental settings are stored in a yaml file, users do not have to write codes.
- **Easy to compare neural-based model with non-neural-based model**: Because bunruija supports models based on scikit-learn and PyTorch in the same framework, users can easily compare neural- and non-neural-based models.
- **Easy to reproduice the training of a model**: Because all hyperparameters of a model are stored in a yaml file, it is easy to reproduice the model.


## Install
```
python setup.py install
